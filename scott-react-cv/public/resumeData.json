His maturity levels for someone of his age are fantastic and this flows through into his work, he is not fazed by the things he does not know, he just see's them as things he is about to know very well.Whilst still relatively early on his career, Scott's future looks very bright and I hope to continue to work with him as he inevitably moves onwards and upwards in his career.",
